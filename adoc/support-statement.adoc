[id=sec.Support]
== Support Statement for {product}

To receive support, you need an appropriate subscription with {suse}. For
more information, see
https://www.suse.com/support/?id=SUSE_Cloud_Application_Platform.

The following definitions apply:

=== Version Support
Technical Support and Troubleshooting (L1 - L2): Current and previous major versions (_n_-1). For example: {suse} will provide technical support and troubleshooting for versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (and all 2.x point releases) until the release of 3.0.

Patches and updates (L3): On the latest or last minor release of each major release. For example: {suse} will provide patches and updates for 1.3 (and 2._latest_) until the release of 3.0.

{product} closely follows upstream {cf} releases which may implement fixes and changes which are not backwards compatible with previous releases. {suse} will backport patches for critical bugs and security issues on a best efforts basis.

=== Platform Support
{product} is fully supported on {eksa}, {azure} {aksa} and Google GKE. Each release is tested by {product} QA on these platforms.

{product} is fully supported on {caaspa}, wherever it happens to be installed. If {caaspa} is supported on a particular CSP, the customer can get support for {product} in that context.

{suse} can provide support for {product} on 3rd party/generic {k8s} on a case-by-case basis provided:

a. the Kubernetes cluster satisfies the Requirements listed here: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-cap/1.5.1/html/cap-guides/cha-cap-depl-kube-requirements.html#sec-cap-changes-kube-reqs
b. The `kube-ready-state-check.sh` script has been run on the target {k8s} cluster and does not show any configuration problems
c. a SUSE Services or Sales Engineer has verified that {product} works correctly on the target {k8s} cluster

Any incident with {product} is also fully supported as long as the problem can be replicated on {caaspa}, {aksa}, {eksa} or GKE. Bugs identified on 3rd party / generic {k8s} which are unique to that platform and can not be replicated on the core supported platforms are fixed on a best efforts basis. {suse} will not replicate the deployed Kubernetes environment internally in order to reproduce errors.

{suse} will only support the usage of original packages. That is, packages that are unchanged and not recompiled.
