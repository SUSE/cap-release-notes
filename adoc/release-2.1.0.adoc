[id='sec.2_1_0.issue']
==== Known Issues

* TCP routing is not available for Eirini
* Converting from Diego to Eirini will leave older Diego pods up
* Converting from Diego to Eirini might cause apps to enter a crashed state which
  requires restaging the app, or re-pushing the app with `cf push -s sle15` if
  the `cflinuxfs3` stack was used
* Converting from Diego to Eirini requires first upgrading to CAP 2.1 because
  CAP 2.0.1 or lower do not support Eirini
* Eirini will require k8s-metrics-server for Stratos Metrics to work
* Metrics will not show disk stats on Eirini
* Eirini apps require slightly more memory (approximately 32MB)
* Memory limits on pods (same as above? *fixme*)
* log-cache settings needed (same as below? *fixme*)
* log-cache needs to have set `memory_limit_percent: 3` as a workaround for
 a problem with allocating memory within log-cache
* The v3 API used by cf-cli v7 should not be interchangeable with the v2 API
 (cf-cli v6) based on certain functionality that is not compatible. Stratos
 also has problems relying on v3 API and in comparison to v2, performance
 degradation is expected
* Support for public cloud service brokers was removed
* Existing HA setups of internal database on CAP 2.0.x (or KubeCF) need to scale
  down `sizing.database.instances` to 1 in order to upgrade to CAP 2.1
* Upgrades to 2.1 will result in some downtime in apps
