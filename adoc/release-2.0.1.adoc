[IMPORTANT]
.Mitigating Gorouter DoS Attacks (CVE-2020-15586)
====
The current release of {product} is affected by CVE-2020-15586 whereby the Gorouter is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack via requests with the "Expect: 100-continue" header. For details regarding this vulnerability, see https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2020-15586/.

If available, operators are advised to upgrade to a {product} release that is not affected by this vulnerability. Always review the release notes (https://suse.com/releasenotes/) to verify whether a given {product} release is affected. If it is not possible to upgrade immediately, we recommend operators follow the mitigations from Cloud Foundry's security update (see https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2020-15586/):
* Configure an HTTP load balancer in front of the Gorouters to drop the `Expect 100-continue` header completely.
** This may cause delays in HTTP clients that utilize the Expect: 100 continue behavior. However, this should not affect the correctness of HTTP applications.
* Configure an HTTP load balancer in front of the Gorouters to drop the `Expect: 100-continue` header and immediately respond with “100 Continue”.
** This may cause HTTP clients to send the request body unnecessarily in some cases where the server would have responded with a final status code before requesting the body. However, this should not affect the correctness of HTTP applications.

If you are using a TCP / L4 load balancer for your Gorouters instead of an HTTP load balancer, consider the following:
* Add firewall rules to prevent traffic from any source making requests that are causing this panic.
** You may use the link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/blob/c0cc507397808e2ea53b63ca9703551fefc6da85/jobs/gorouter/spec#L175-L177[extra_headers_to_log] property to enable logging of the “Expect” request header to help identify sources of this malicious traffic.
