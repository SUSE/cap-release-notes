== Release Notes SUSE Cloud Application Platform 1.0.1

These are the release notes for SUSE Cloud Application Platform 1.0. It contains additional information specific to the current release. See the link:https://www.suse.com/documentation/cloud-application-platform-1/[Deployment Guide] for details information how to deploy the product.

=== Known issues

* Do not set the `mysql` or `diego_access` roles to more than one instance each in HA configurations. Doing so can cause problems with subsequent upgrades which could lead to loss of data. Scalability of these roles will be enabled in an upcoming maintenance release.
* A `helm upgrade` command from 1.0 to 1.0.1 (scf 2.6.11 to 2.7.0) requires the use of `--force` to drop an unnecessary persistent volume. Note that `helm upgrade` only works for multi-node clusters when running with a proper HA storage class (e.g. `hostpath` will not work as required stateful data can be lost).

== 1.1 Release April, 2018

* Changes to working with upgrades:
** All the secrets have been moved from `env.FOO` to `secrets.FOO`, it is necessary to modify the `scf-values.yaml` file to match.
** Secrets won't be carried forward automatically anymore, it is necessary to keep specifying *all* the secrets on each upgrade (e.g. the CLUSTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
** `kube.external_ip` has become `kube.external_ips` and is a list instead of a single value.
** To rotate secrets it is necessary to increment the `kube.secret_generation_counter` (Note, immutable generated secrets will not be reset).
